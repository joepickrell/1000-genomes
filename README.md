Annotation of 1000 Genomes variants

Joe Pickrell

Each file has all of the variants called from ALL.[chr].integrated_phase1_v3.20101123.snps_indels_svs.genotypes.vcf.gz. These files were downloaded from:

ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20110521/

For each variant, we list the chromosome, position (hg19 coordinates), and rs number, followed by the annotations. "1" means the variant falls in the annotation, and "0" means it does not. All annotations are described in the Supplementary Material of Pickrell (2013) http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4843. The "tssdist" annotation is the distance to the nearest transcription start site in the Ensembl gene databases as downloaded from the UCSC genome browser on 3/19/2013.
